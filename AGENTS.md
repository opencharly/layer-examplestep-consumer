# AGENTS.md — layer-examplestep-consumer

Standalone reference/fixture candy repo for the build-time plugin-execution
example. The candy lives in `charly.yml` at the repo root: the plugin-candy
`candy:` reference, the build-context `run:` step with `plugin: examplestep`, and
the runtime `check:` step that proves the bake ran. It carries **no `skill:`
entity**, so no owning `/charly-<family>:<name>` skill is projected into the
marketplace corpus.

Canonical files:

- `charly.yml` — the `examplestep-consumer:` candy entity (no `skill:` entity
  present).
- `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml` — CalVer tag + `CHANGELOG/` on merge.
- `README.md` — user overview only; never agent guidance.

## Load these skills first (R0)

- `/charly-internals:plugin` — the closest owning skill: the plugin model, the
  build-path plugin connect + `invokeVerbBuildEmit` seam this fixture exercises,
  the per-plugin CUE schema contract, and the loader. Load before editing or
  troubleshooting the fixture.
- `/charly-image:layer` — the candy authoring reference (`charly.yml` schema,
  `plan:` step verbs incl. `check:`/`run:`, the plugin-step form, package
  sections). Load before editing any entity field or plan step.

There is no dedicated `/charly-*:examplestep-consumer` owning skill — this repo's
candy carries no `skill:` entity. The gap is recorded against
`opencharly/opencharly#291`; when one is authored, add it here.

## Build / validate / test

- The merge gate is the **org-wide** `charly/pr-validator` (required check
  `validate / validate`, defined in `opencharly/.github`); this repo has **no
  per-repo candy gate** and ships only `.github/workflows/tag-on-merge.yml`.
- The candy's `plan:` `check:` step is the functional evidence:
  `examplestep-baked-present` asserts `/opt/examplestep-baked` exists in the
  built image (runtime context), proving the build-time `OpEmit` splice ran.
- The fixture only proves anything when composed WITH
  `candy/plugin-example-step`, which provides the `examplestep` verb.

## Modify this repo

- Edit the `examplestep-consumer:` candy entity in `charly.yml`. Keep the
  `plugin:` verb name aligned with the provider the plugin candy declares, and
  keep the runtime `check:` asserting the spliced artifact.
- This is a reference/fixture candy — a change here is a change to the documented
  build-context external-plugin example, so keep it minimal and observable.

## Landing

- PR-only. Every change lands through a pull request; the org-required
  `charly/pr-validator` validates the diff and body and arms native auto-merge
  on PASS. Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
- History lives in `CHANGELOG/` (written by `tag-on-merge` at merge time); the
  PR body IS the changelog.
- The authoritative rulebook is the umbrella `AGENTS.md` in
  `opencharly/opencharly` and `charly/AGENTS.md` in the charly repo. Do not
  restate its rules here.
